Project Motivation

The project motivation was to get some insights in software developement as a carreer. What should you bring and what to concentrate on when wanting to get hired. The data was taken from Stack Overflow.
The following questions were asked:

    How many people took part in the survey in 2017?
    How many of those people are professional software developers?
    What characteristics do software developers have? What is the average opinion of developers on certain statements, that are related to software developement?
    What are professionals (software developers)looking for when hiring a new software developer? What areas should one concentrate on when it comes to applying for jobs?
    How to find a job in software developement? What strategies and ways led to success for the survey participants?
    What sites are most commonly used by software developers to put their profile/CV on for job hunt?
